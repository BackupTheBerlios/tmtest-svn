// TODO: should we ensure that minibufs are a multiple of the page size?
// Probably.  That means we need to subtract out the minibuf overhead and
// then say a 2048K minibuf actually stores 2032 bytes, but 2 minibufs
// fit exactly into a kernel page.  But...  Is there any guarantee malloc
// will return blocks aligned to pages?  Probably not...



/** Minibufs are used all throughout this proxy to buffer data.
 * They allow us to preserve data between event loops, yet we
 * don't need to allocate a per-connection static buffer.
 * 
 * They are super fast to acquire and return.  All minibufs
 * live in a mempool.
 * 
 * The C99 spec (n1124.pdf) ยง6.7.2.1:18 claims that "t1.d[0] = 4.2;" might be
 * undefined behavior.  That's retarded.  Is "*(t1.d+0)" valid?  What about
 * "(void*)&t1.d"?  The spec doesn't say.  WTF?  How is this supposed to be
 * useful??  gcc does the right thing in all cases (and has for many years)
 * so I'll use C99's "flexible array members" but this might need to change
 * if we ever use a nonconformant compiler.
